# Restaurant_Picker
This program is a random restaurant picker. This idea came from my girlfriend and I never being able to decide where we wanted to eat. 
This program generates a random restaurant and the restaurants are stored as strings on a .txt file. The user is also able to add new restaurants to be stored into the .txt file or remove old ones from the .txt file. 
For ease of access, the user is also able to see all restaurants already on the .txt file. 

For future development, I would like to add a UI to make the program easier to use and understand. 
Also incorporating databases instead of .txt files.
